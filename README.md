🕶️🔐 PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER

“Your first line of defense isn’t a firewall. It’s your password.”

🧬 Project Overview

In a world where brute-force attacks run 24/7 and credentials are traded like currency, weak passwords are an open invitation.

This Password Strength Checker is a real-time security evaluation tool built using pure frontend technologies. It visually analyzes password complexity and instantly classifies its strength.

No frameworks. No backend. Just raw logic.

⚡ Live Behavior

As you type:

The strength bar grows.

The color shifts from danger red to secure blue.

The classification updates instantly.

The UI responds smoothly.

Everything happens client-side in real-time.

🧠 Security Logic Engine

The algorithm assigns points based on:

✔ Length ≥ 8 characters
✔ Length ≥ 12 characters
✔ Contains uppercase letters
✔ Contains numbers
✔ Contains special characters

🏁 Strength Levels
Score	Classification
0–1	🔴 Very Weak
2	🟠 Weak
3	🟡 Medium
4	🟢 Strong
5	🔵 Very Strong
